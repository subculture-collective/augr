# OpenCode OAuth provider

Use this provider when Augr should authenticate to OpenAI with a ChatGPT
account. Augr does not receive an OpenAI API key or the OAuth credential. It
calls a private, password-protected OpenCode service on the internal Compose
network.

## Security boundary

- The OpenCode image and digest are pinned in `docker-compose.nuc.yml`.
- The service has no published port and no Augr repository mount. Its private
  API is on the internal backend network; a separate bridge permits only the
  outbound provider traffic required for OAuth refresh and inference.
- Its working directory is an empty, no-exec temporary filesystem.
- Sharing is disabled, agent steps are limited to one, and every permission is
  denied in both the server configuration and every Augr-created session.
- Only the OpenCode service mounts its OAuth data directory. The Augr app gets
  the service password, not the OAuth credential.

## Bootstrap authentication

1. Set a long random `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` in the deployment `.env`.
2. Set `OPENCODE_AUTH_DIR` to a root-owned deployment directory. It defaults to
   `/var/lib/augr-opencode` on the Compose host.
3. Create the directory with mode `0700`.
4. Authenticate interactively from the Compose host:

   ```sh
   docker compose -f docker-compose.nuc.yml run --rm --entrypoint opencode opencode auth login
   ```

   Select OpenAI and then the ChatGPT Plus/Pro browser login. This stores the
   refreshable OAuth credential only in `OPENCODE_AUTH_DIR`.

5. Configure the primary, tier, and same-service model fallback:

   ```dotenv
   LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER=opencode
   LLM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=opencode
   LLM_DEEP_THINK_MODEL=openai/gpt-6-sol
   LLM_QUICK_THINK_MODEL=openai/gpt-6-luna
   LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER=opencode
   LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.6-terra
   OPENCODE_BASE_URL=http://opencode:4096
   OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME=opencode
   OPENCODE_MODEL=openai/gpt-6-sol
   ```

All OpenCode models use `provider/model` form. GPT-6 Sol handles deep-think work,
GPT-6 Luna handles high-volume quick-think work, and GPT-5.6 Terra is the
fallback for model-specific failures. GPT-6 has no Terra tier, so the fallback
stays on the previous generation. `openai/gpt-6-astra` is also available as a
higher-cost deep-think option.

OpenCode 1.18.32 predates GPT-6 Luna and Sol, so `ops/opencode/opencode.json`
declares both under `provider.openai.models`. Remove that block once the pinned
OpenCode image lists them in `opencode models openai`. This fallback does not protect against a complete
OpenCode sidecar or OAuth outage.

## Verify

Start the service and app, then confirm health without printing the password:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.nuc.yml up -d opencode app
docker compose -f docker-compose.nuc.yml ps opencode app
docker compose -f docker-compose.nuc.yml exec -T opencode sh -ec \
  'auth=$(printf "%s:%s" "$OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME" "$OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD" | base64 | tr -d "\n"); wget -qO- --header="Authorization: Basic $auth" http://127.0.0.1:4096/global/health'
```

Induce or reproduce a non-destructive primary-provider failure and verify that
the completion succeeds with `used_fallback=true` and model
the expected 5.6 model. Review logs for fallback count, latency, malformed JSON,
and primary recovery before considering the integration healthy.

## Rotate or revoke

- Rotate only `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` to invalidate Augr-to-OpenCode access.
- Run `opencode auth logout` through the same one-off Compose command to revoke
  the stored provider login, then re-authenticate.
- To disable immediately, clear `LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER` and recreate the app.
  The primary provider remains unchanged.

Do not copy `auth.json` into the repository, the app container, logs, support
bundles, or backups that are not encrypted as secrets.

## Quota failures and interrupted requests

A healthy sidecar does not prove available inference quota. Inspect authenticated
session status and the sidecar's private logs when completions time out. A
`The usage limit has been reached` retry is a quota failure; switching between
models on the same OAuth account does not establish independent capacity. Wait
for available quota or qualify an existing local provider separately. Do not add
a paid API fallback as part of this recovery.

After an interrupted completion, Augr requests the documented session abort
before deleting the temporary session. Cleanup uses its own five-second deadline
so it still runs after caller cancellation. If abort fails or is not acknowledged,
it retains the session instead of deleting storage beneath a retrying task. The
original completion error remains the caller's result. Existing orphaned tasks
need a separate, scoped recovery; deploying this client change does not prove
that they have stopped or that quota is available.
