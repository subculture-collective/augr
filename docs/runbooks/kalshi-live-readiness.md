# Kalshi live readiness

## Purpose

Use this runbook only when preparing a future Kalshi strategy for live trading.
Current default remains paper/data only. Discovery creates paper strategies,
and Sprint C still keeps live submission gated. When Kalshi credentials are
present, the runtime now wires a live adapter, but `newBrokerForStrategy` still
blocks live routing unless `ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING`, the strategy allowlist, the
broker allowlist, and client wiring all pass.

## Required gates before any live order

- `ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING=true`
- `LIVE_TRADING_ALLOWED_BROKERS=kalshi`
- `LIVE_TRADING_ALLOWED_STRATEGIES=<strategy uuid>`
- `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID`
- `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM_B64`
- A real Kalshi live client wired and initialised

## Wire-format verification (cannot be done offline)

The live adapter in `internal/execution/kalshi/live_client.go` targets the
public Kalshi Trade API v2 shape as documented on 2026-09-23:

- `POST /portfolio/orders` with `{ticker, action: buy|sell, side: yes|no,
  count: <int>, type: "limit", yes_price|no_price: <cents>, client_order_id,
  time_in_force}`
- `DELETE /portfolio/orders/{order_id}`
- `GET /portfolio/orders?status=resting|executed|canceled&limit=&cursor=` with
  client-side matching on `client_order_id` (Kalshi does not filter by it)
- Order status values: `resting`, `pending`, `executed`, `canceled`,
  `expired`; anything else is logged and treated as still working

Before enabling live routing, verify each item against the current Kalshi API
reference and one sandbox/demo round trip, because the unit tests only prove
the adapter matches the shape above, not that Kalshi still accepts it:

- [ ] Order create body field names, `count` as an integer, price fields in
      cents (or `*_dollars` strings if the docs changed), and `time_in_force`
      enum values
- [ ] Cancel path and method
- [ ] Order list filters (`status`, `limit`, `cursor`) and the order status
      enum
- [ ] Market orders remain rejected at planning (`order_mapping.go`) until a
      sandbox smoke test covers them
- [ ] `KALSHI_API_BASE_URL` points at the intended host: the demo default is
      `https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2`; production is
      `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`
- [ ] `common_lifecycle.go` still posts to `/portfolio/events/orders` with
      bid/ask sides; confirm which path is routed before relying on it

## Preflight checks

Run these before any live activation work:

```bash
curl -sf http://10.0.0.56:3030/healthz
curl -sf http://10.0.0.56:3029/kalshi
# Authenticated API check, run with an operator token/session if available:
curl -sf http://10.0.0.56:3030/api/v1/kalshi/summary
```

Check the latest discovery run and watched market state in the dashboard/API
before changing strategy mode. Confirm the active paper strategy is healthy and
has the expected market/ticker history.

Focused validation:

```bash
rtk go test ./internal/execution/kalshi -run 'Broker|Map|Reconciler' -count=1
rtk go test ./cmd/tradingagent -run 'Kalshi|LiveGate|Broker|Paper|Strategy' -count=1
```

## First live strategy procedure

1. Clone one proven paper strategy.
2. Keep max sizing tiny.
3. Set `is_paper=false` only after every gate above is satisfied and the live
   client is ready.
4. Run the strategy manually once.
5. Verify the submitted order, broker response, and reconciliation/position
   state.

## Rollback procedure

1. Remove `kalshi` from `LIVE_TRADING_ALLOWED_BROKERS`.
2. Remove the strategy UUID from `LIVE_TRADING_ALLOWED_STRATEGIES`.
3. Set the strategy back to `is_paper=true`.
4. Restart the app.
5. Verify `http://10.0.0.56:3030/healthz` is still healthy.

## Safety notes

- Do not place secrets in this document.
- Do not auto-promote paper strategies to live.
- Do not enable discovery to create live strategies.
- Keep paper/data defaults as the normal operating mode until a deliberate
  live change is approved and wired end-to-end.
